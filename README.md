# CapstoneProject1 Ecommerce Website with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

## A website that displays basic pages and layout for an e-commerce store, it lacks Javascript so it is not fully functional.

This project is built on the idea of making a place where multiple "vendors" or artists who produce their own products and put them up for sale by signing up and uploading themselves. This project showcases:

* Displays a homepage that features what the store's purpose is for
* Features a Login and Registration page that uses HTML validation for the forms
* Features a product page to display different items that are up for sale using Bootstrap's card features
* Has an example checkout page with an order summary
